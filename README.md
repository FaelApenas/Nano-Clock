# NANO-CLOCK
This is a small project that i want to try.

I want to try building a clock without a RTC module 

The project was build using a Arduino Nano and a 4 digits 7 segments display. 

=================================================================================

# Files 
7seg -> Functions to handle the 7 segments display 

main -> Main file 

=================================================================================

# Compile 
I have used the plataformIO from VSCODE to run this application 
but if you want to use the Arduino IDE you can just copy and paste the code.

Remember to use copy the "7seg" functions to your code.
